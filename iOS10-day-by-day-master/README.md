# iOS10 Day by Day

Apple introduced iOS 10 at WWDC in June 2016. The new SDK is, as always, full of exciting new features to explore: the biggest being Messages Extensions and hooks to integrate your application with Siri.

The aim of this blog series is to present these new features in an accessible format which doesn't simply regurgitate the documentation, but instead walks you through sample projects that demonstrate how the technology can be used. These projects can be found within this repository.

You can read more about the series and find the published posts [here](http://shinobicontrols.com/blog/ios-10-day-by-day-index).
